      Akshay Hari Om Bhatia[1] (born Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia; 9 September 1967[2]),
      known professionally as Akshay Kumar (pronounced [əkˈʂəj kʊˈmɑːɾ]), is an
      Indian actor and film producer working in Hindi cinema.
      <br /> <br>
      Referred to in the media as "Khiladi Kumar",[3][4] through his career
      spanning over 30 years, Kumar has appeared in over 100 films and has won
      several awards, including two National Film Awards and two Filmfare
      Awards. He received the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian
      honour, from the Government of India in 2009. Kumar is one of the most
      prolific actors in Indian cinema. <br /> <br>
      [5][6] Forbes included Kumar in their lists of both highest-paid
      celebrities and highest-paid actors in the world from 2015 to 2020.[7][8]
      Between 2019 and 2020, he was the only Canadian on both lists.[9][10][11]
      Kumar began his career in 1991 with Saugandh and had his first commercial
      success a year later with the action thriller Khiladi. <br /> <br>
      The film established him as an action star in the 1990s and led to several
      films in the Khiladi film series, in addition to other action films such
      as Mohra (1994) and Jaanwar (1999). Although his early tryst with romance
      in Yeh Dillagi (1994) was positively received, it was in the next decade
      that Kumar expanded his range of roles. He gained recognition for the
      romantic films Dhadkan (2000), Andaaz (2003), Namastey London (2007), and
      for his slapstick comic performances in several films including Hera Pheri
      (2000), Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), Phir Hera Pheri (2006), Bhool
      Bhulaiyaa (2007), and Singh Is Kinng (2008). Kumar won Filmfare Awards for
      his negative role in Ajnabee (2001) and his comic performance in Garam
      Masala (2005).
